My current research focuses on strengthening agents’ task-completion and decision-making capabilities, while ensuring the appropriate and responsible use of user data.\nPreviously, I contributed to privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) efforts, building and optimizing LLMs for a broad range of NLP tasks with differential privacy (DP) at the core. Highlights include:\n\nModernizing the Editor Text Predictions model with a transformer architecture fine-tuned under differential privacy, improving predictive accuracy while reducing operational costs across all Outlook endpoints.\nDeveloping privacy-preserving synthetic data pipelines by fine-tuning LLMs with differential privacy to generate high-quality data for classification and clustering; this work was featured in a Microsoft Research blog post.\n\n\n\n\nBefore joining Microsoft, I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2020, where I was advised by Prof. Ayfer Özgür. Prior to that, I earned my M.Sc. from Koç University in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Alper Erdoğan, and my B.Sc. from Boğaziçi University in 2012."

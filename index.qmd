## Research

I am a **Principal Researcher at M365 Research**, where I work on designing **reinforcement learning (RL) methods for agentic large language models (LLMs)**. My current research focuses on strengthening agents’ **task-completion and decision-making capabilities**, while ensuring the **appropriate and responsible use of user data**.

Previously, I contributed to **privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML)** efforts, building and optimizing LLMs for a broad range of NLP tasks with **differential privacy (DP)** at the core. Highlights include:

- Modernizing the **Editor Text Predictions** model with a transformer architecture fine-tuned under differential privacy, improving predictive accuracy while reducing operational costs across all Outlook endpoints.
- Developing **privacy-preserving synthetic data pipelines** by fine-tuning LLMs with differential privacy to generate high-quality data for classification and clustering; this work was featured in a **[Microsoft Research blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-crossroads-of-innovation-and-privacy-private-synthetic-data-for-generative-ai/)**.

## Education

Before joining Microsoft, I received my **Ph.D. from Stanford University** in 2020, where I was advised by **Prof. Ayfer Özgür**. Prior to that, I earned my **M.Sc. from Koç University** in 2014 under the supervision of **Prof. Alper Erdoğan**, and my **B.Sc. from Boğaziçi University** in 2012.
